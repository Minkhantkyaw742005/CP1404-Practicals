# Practical Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions and code for the practical assignments in CP1404.

## About Me

My name is Min Khant Kyaw, a student currently enrolled in James Cook University Singapore. This repository showcases my
work in CP1404, where I apply programming concepts to practical assignments.

## Clean Code Lessons

1. **Consistent Naming:** Ensured that variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming
   convention throughout the codebase.

2. **Modularization:** Encapsulated functionality into separate functions and classes, following the Single
   Responsibility Principle (SRP) to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. **Meaningful Comments:** Provided clear and concise comments to explain complex sections of code, making it easier
   for others (or future self) to understand the purpose and functionality.
